# Affinity Designer feature wishlist

We're going to keep any notes about what we're missing in Affinity designer / that keeps us stuck using Adobe Illustrator for some things - _here_.

(and we'll keep them in order of desire)

Note: if you are a [PE](https://perpetual.education) student, we usually just call it "_The graphics program_" in the course materials - but in this document: we will being abbreviating _Affinity Designer_ to <abbr title="Affinity Designer">AD</abbr>.

## Transform
insert image and description. Basically, we'd like to be able to distort a box and some text. Imagine having a wall with space and perspective, or a floor, and then matching up a graphic to that sheer or skew or perspective - or whatever it's called. Figure that out - and add it here to be 100% clear. Of course, you'll need to use another program - to be able to do it / to show it - because AD cannot.
